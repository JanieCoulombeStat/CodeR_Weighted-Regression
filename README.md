# CodeR_Weighted-Regression
R code related to Biometrics paper on Weighted Regression Analysis 

Authors: Janie Coulombe, Erica E.M. Moodie, Robert W. Platt. 

The R program Weighted_Regression.R can be used to:

1. Simulate datasets (one row per time per ID) with time discretized at 0.01 (first part in the loop)
2. Estimate the marginal effect of treatment via the FIPTM or the IPCTM estimators: both are presented in
   the program (middle part in the loop)
3. Estimate the asymptotic variance of the FIPTM estimator (last part of the loop)
